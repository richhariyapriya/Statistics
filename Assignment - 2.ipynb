    "**Ans:-** In this scenario, a reasonable distribution to model the number of raindrops hitting a particular region in a given time interval is the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space when these events happen with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.\n",

    "The Poisson distribution has a probability mass function (PMF) given by:\n",

    "\\[ P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^k}{k!} \\]\n",

    "- \\(X\\) is the number of events (raindrops),\n",
    "- \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer (the number of events),\n",
    "- \\(\\lambda\\) is the average rate of events per unit of time (in this case, the average rate of raindrops per square inch per minute), and\n",
    "- \\(e\\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given problem, let's denote the average rate of raindrops per square inch per minute as \\(\\lambda\\). Since the rate is given as 20 drops per square inch per minute, we have \\(\\lambda = 20\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you're interested in the probability that the region has no raindrops in a given 3-second time interval. First, you need to convert the time interval to minutes since the rate is given in drops per square inch per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{3 seconds} = \\frac{3}{60} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n",

    "Now, plug in the values into the Poisson PMF:\n",
