    "**Ans:-** No, an event cannot be independent of itself. In probability theory, the concept of independence between events refers to the idea that the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the occurrence or non-occurrence of another event.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation implies that knowing whether event A occurred or not provides no information about the likelihood of event B occurring, and vice versa.\n",

    "If we were to consider an event being independent of itself, it would imply:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A \\cap A) = P(A) \\cdot P(A) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this would mean that the probability of both A and A occurring is equal to the square of the probability of A occurring. For any non-trivial event (i.e., an event with a probability other than 0 or 1), this equality does not hold, and it violates the definition of independence. Therefore, it is not meaningful to talk about an event being independent of itself in classical probability theory."
